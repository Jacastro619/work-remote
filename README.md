## Description 

[Visit the Deployed "Work Remote" site](https://youtu.be/BFyeuLhjcPY) üëÄ


The Global Remote Workplace Services Market size is estimated to grow from USD 20.1 billion in 2022 to USD 58.5 billion by 2027, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 23.8% during the forecast period, according to a report by MarketsandMarkets.  This is a HUGE market (currently 20.1 Billion),  that is increasing at a staggering rate (23.8% annually).  

How does a person find remote work opportunities? There needs to be a way for people needing remote work to be done to find people capable of doing that work. 

This project which we have named ‚ÄúWork Remote‚Äù provides the ability for people who need remote work to be done to post their projects.  And for people looking to do remote work, to find those projects and contact the person who posted it. "Work Remote" is a job board for remote workers.

## Usage and Features

This project has three separate users in mind:

1. All Users
2. The Job Post User (Client)
3. The Job Viewer User (Worker)

#### Concerning All Users:

All users can go to the site and are limited to viewing the 6 most recent project posts without being logged in.  In order to see all the job posts or to make a job post a user must make an account by entering their user name, email, and password. This information is saved to the server.  For security purposes, the user's password is made into a hash by using npm bcrypt and is stored on the server not as a raw password but as a hash.

When a user is a returning user (coming back to the site for a 2nd or more time) when they enter their username and password, bcrypt hashes the password they entered and then looks for a matching hash and username on the server. If a match is found they are logged in.  Once logged in the users behavior defines if they are now a Client or Worker.

#### Concerning Client Users
Once logged in, a Client User can go to ‚ÄúMy Job Listing‚Äù or ‚ÄúPost Job‚Äù if they would like to view and edit their existing job posts or make a new job post respectively. If a Client clicks on ‚ÄúMy Job Listing‚Äù they are taken to a list of all of their current job posts.  Once there, each job has the option to ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù (Which shows the entirety of that job post as it is, and is not editable). ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù (Which shows the job in an editor where ALL of the job properties are editable. This is really nice if a user wants to modify the requirements of a job, maybe even change the type of job, and can of course modify their budget).

#### Concerning Worker Users
Once logged in, a Worker User can go to ‚ÄúSee Jobs‚Äù and the entire list of all available jobs will be shown to them.  At the same time, a drop-down sort function is given to them at the top of the page where they can select the jobs to be displayed to them by category, where only the category of job they choose will then be shown to them. 

The Worker User can then select a job to view by clicking on ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù.  That will display for them the listing of the job with all of the details including a contact email at the bottom where if they are interested in the work they can email the job poster.  If they click on the email button their e-mail editor will automatically open and the Clients email will be automatically populated.
