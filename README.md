Presentation Template 

Your presentations are a reflection of the work that you have done as a team. We should have a clear understanding of what the application does, why it was built, and how it was built before we ever experienced your application demo.

Your presentation should translate easily to your informative README. 

Presentation 
Description of what it does w/ Visual Support: Gif / Image of your app doing it.
Motivation for building this w/ Research you did: Into existing apps how is this different how is this the same?
How did you build it out? w/ Infographic of your work-flow
User Stories => Features => task => Branches => Git Commits
User Stories w/ Gif of your application UI completing that user story
Planning Wireframe w/ Side by Side of initial Wireframe vs. end product
Task Assignment => Who did what?
Team work-flow => Working Agreements Stand-ups Playbacks
